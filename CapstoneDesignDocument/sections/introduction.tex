\section{Problem Statement} 
%-------------------------------------------%

Can we create a fair and balanced artificial intelligence that plays video games almost like a human? How can we apply artificial intelligence in entertainment?


%-------------------------------------------%



\section{Purpose Statement} 
%-------------------------------------------%

We shall create an artificial intelligence that uses the same information available to players in order to make decisions. We shall also closely train the Agent to reproduce human-like on a reliable scale.

\section{Context} 
%-------------------------------------------%

Interest in Artificial Intelligence(A.I.) has been present since nearly the beginning of computing. However, over the past few years interest in A.I. has been growing. With the recent popularity of A.I. techniques like Artificial Neural Networks, many groups have made huge advancements in the field. Companies like Google are constantly in the news for their groundbreaking projects. Google's AlphaGo is an amazing example of the work that can be done, this A.I. was able to beat the world's best human Go player, and is still improving beyond this point.

Other groups are contributing to the advancement of A.I, although they are not as easily recognizable. A research platform called ViZDoom is a great example that also relates to this project quite well. ViZDoom is an Open Source platform that allows users to create Agents in the Video Game Doom, these Game Agents are doing what any human player would, trying to maximize their score. However, they are playing using only the Visual Buffer. This approach is very similar to how humans play the game, and was also a large inspiration to this project. Yet, ViZDoom is still primarily a research platform.

Finding cutting-edge A.I. techniques in the Game Industry is quite hard. Many developers find these techniques to be both impractical and excessive. These implementations use up sought after resources. Why should they create more work for themselves when many of the problems that we are looking to solve can be reduced to smaller problems with nice well defined algorithms?

With this information, one may think that almost no one uses advanced A.I. in games,
and that is primarily the case. However, some companies are implementing these advanced techniques. Instead of using A.I. to create a diverse experience, they use it to push sales for specific features. This is the case with Activision's patent for "[driving] micro transactions in multiplayer video games".

\section{Significance of Project} 
%-------------------------------------------%

This project's significance comes from the current scarcity of A.I. projects in entertainment. A.I. is one of the quickest growing fields right now, we think that it is important to create a precedent and show both developers and users what these advanced techniques can be used for. If these techniques are continued to be used to take advantage of users, it is possible that A.I. will be "stuck" in this state.
