This project would not be possible without the support and generosity of the {\it Rivals of Aether} community. We would like to offer our heartfelt gratitude to Etalus, girlritchie, and ICleanWindows for their direct contributions to our dataset. We are also grateful to everyone who took the time to engage with our thread, even if only to offer a comment of support or vote us up for visibility.

Lastly, we wish to thank Dan Fornace, flashygoodness, and the {\it Rivals of Aether} development team.
